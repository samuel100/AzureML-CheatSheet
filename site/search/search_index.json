AML provides a flexible set of tools built on top of Azure's powerful infrastructure. In this tutorial we introduce the fundamental concepts required to quickly get started with AML. Lesson 1: Setup (5 minutes) Register your AML workspace, get the Azure ML Python SDK and create your compute infrastructure. Lesson 2: Hello AML (10 minutes) Train our first model in the cloud with Azure ML's Python SDK. Lesson 3: Environments (10 minutes) Manage our training environments with conda, pip and docker.
