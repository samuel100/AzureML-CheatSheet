## Introduction to Azure Machine Learning

Azure Machine Learning (AML) is a cloud service built for end-to-end machine learning, from developing in interactive notebooks and training on scalable clusters of VMs to monitoring key performance metrics and deploying models into production. AML provides a flexible set of tools built on top of Azure's powerful infrastructure.

In this tutorial we introduce the fundamental concepts required to quickly get started with AML.

**[Lesson 1: Setup](lesson01-setup.md)** _(5 minutes)_  
Register your AML workspace, get the Azure ML Python SDK and create your compute infrastructure.

**[Lesson 2: Hello AML](lesson02-hello_aml.md)** _(10 minutes)_  
Train our first model in the cloud with Azure ML's Python SDK.

**[Lesson 3: Environments](lesson03-environments.md)** _(10 minutes)_  
Manage our training environments with conda, pip and docker.
