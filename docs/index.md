# Deep learning with Azure ML

Welcome the the Azure Machine Learning (AML) 60-minute blitz (inspired by the excellent [PyTorch 60-minute blitz](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html)).

By the end of this session you will:

- Be able to train and monitor models on Azure using the AML Python SDK
- Scale up your compute resources (from a single CPU to a distributed cluster of GPUs)
- Some other things too perhaps :-)

**NOTE.** [This page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/overview/azure/ml/?view=azure-ml-py) is a good skeleton for the 60-minute blitz for the Python SDK.

**Session 1** - [Getting started with the Azure ML Python SDK](session-01.md)



<!-- ## Getting Started

- Getting your AML Workspace set up
- Set up compute instance
- Set up compute cluster

## Managing Environments

- With conda
- With pip
- With docker
- With custom estimators

## Running Scripts Remotely

- Run hello-world.py script on AML remote compute
- Run PyTorch model on AML remote compute
